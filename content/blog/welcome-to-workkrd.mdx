# Welcome to the Work.krd Blog

We are thrilled to officially launch the Work.krd blog — a space dedicated to helping professionals across Kurdistan, Iraq, and the broader Middle East build standout resumes and advance their careers.

## Why We Built Work.krd

The job market in the region is evolving rapidly. International companies are expanding, local startups are booming, and opportunities are opening up for talented professionals everywhere. But there has always been a gap: most resume-building tools are designed exclusively for English speakers writing left-to-right documents. If you write in Arabic, Kurdish (Sorani), or need a bilingual resume, the options have been limited — until now.

Work.krd was created to solve this problem. Our platform is built from the ground up with full support for **right-to-left (RTL) languages**, including Arabic and Central Kurdish (Sorani). Whether you are applying for a position in Erbil, Baghdad, Dubai, or anywhere in the world, Work.krd helps you present yourself professionally in the language that fits your audience.

## What You Can Do with Work.krd

- **Build professional resumes** using beautifully designed, A4-ready templates
- **Write in any language** — English, Arabic, Kurdish, or a mix — with automatic RTL detection
- **Get AI-powered suggestions** to improve your resume content and tailor it to job descriptions
- **Check your ATS score** to make sure your resume passes automated screening systems
- **Download print-ready PDFs** that look exactly as you designed them

## Resume Tips to Get You Started

Here are a few quick tips that apply no matter which language you write in:

1. **Keep it concise.** Aim for one page if you have less than ten years of experience. Two pages maximum for senior professionals.
2. **Use action verbs.** Start each bullet point with a strong verb: "Led," "Designed," "Implemented," "Increased."
3. **Quantify your achievements.** Instead of "Managed a team," say "Managed a team of 12 engineers, delivering 3 projects on time."
4. **Tailor for each application.** Adjust your resume to highlight the skills and experience most relevant to the specific job you are applying for.
5. **Proofread carefully.** Spelling and grammar errors make a poor first impression. Use our built-in tools to catch mistakes before you submit.

## What's Coming Next

This blog will be your go-to resource for career advice, resume writing guides, interview preparation tips, and updates about new features on the platform. We will be publishing content in **English, Arabic, and Kurdish** so that everyone in our community can benefit.

We are just getting started, and we would love to hear from you. If there is a topic you want us to cover or a feature you would like to see on Work.krd, do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for being part of this journey. Let's build something great together.
